Been swapping between many other themes for a very long while, and  I finally had enough.
I've always felt like other themes were a bit lacking or they weren't easy on my eyes, so I finally decided to just make my own theme.


**Reason that this exists: `I was bored, and I hated the fact that my settings.json was full of vscode styles`**
* Let me know if it's broken
* Yes, the name was inspired by Ben Awad, no I'm not trying to steal his idea, this is just a theme pack, please.

***I hope you like it***
